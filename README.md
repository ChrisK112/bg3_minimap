# bg3_minimap
A SourceMod for battle grounds III that adds a working minimap.
Currently shows yourself, and 5 teammates - a source engine limitation of 6 "dots"/hud texts prevents showing more.
Future releases set to allow different modes. e.g. show self only, plus the location of an enemy shot.


Installation instructions:
Place the files into your /bg3/ directory. Make sure /materials/custom files are available for FastDL.
